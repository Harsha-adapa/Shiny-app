# About my Shiny App Project using Titanic Dataset
In this project, we use Shiny which is an interactive R web application system to create a 
dynamic and user-friendly Titanic dataset display tool. With Shiny, we can simply 
transform static data into an engaging and intriguing experience that allows visitors to 
explore the dataset's inner elements.
